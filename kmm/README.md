optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --instances N         Path to the json instances file in COCO format.
  --anchors-sizes N [N ...]
                        List of anchors sizes (e.g. [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]).
  --input-size N        Size according to which each image is resized before
                        being processed by the model.
  --normalizes-bboxes N
                        Normalizes bounding boxes, before giving them input to
                        K-Means, so that they have all an area of ​​1.
                        Default: True.
  --num-runs N          How many times to run K-Means. After the end of all
                        runs the best result is returned. Default: 1.
  --num-anchors-ratios N
                        The number of anchors ratios to generate. Default: 3.
  --max-iter N          Maximum number of iterations of the K-Means algorithm
                        for a single run. Default: 300.
  --min-size N          Size to which all bounding box sizes must be stricly
                        greater to be considered by K-Means. Filtering is
                        applied after rescaling the bounding boxes to the same
                        extent that the images are scaled to adapt them to the
                        input_size. min_size=32 implies that that all the
                        bounding boxes with an area less than or equal to 1024
                        (32 * 32) will be filtered. Default: 0.
  --iou-threshold N     Threshold above which anchors are assigned to ground-
                        truth object boxes. Default: 0.5.
  --decimals N          Number of decimals to use when rounding anchors
                        ratios. Default: 1.
  --default-anchors-ratios N
                        List of anchors ratios to be compared with those found
                        by K-Means. It must be passed as a string, e.g.
                        '[(0.7, 1.4), (1.0, 1.0), (1.4, 0.7)]'. Default:
                        [(0.7, 1.4), (1.0, 1.0), (1.4, 0.7)].

## Updates

* [2020-10-28] fixed error about EfficientDet0 anchors inside the tutorial (thanks @RomRoc) and added code for all EfficientDets
* [2020-06-13] added a comparision with the default anchors ratios, as suggested by @zylo117
* [2020-05-23] added avg. IoU between bounding boxes and anchors
* [2020-05-23] added a function to get annotations whose bounding boxes don't have similar anchors
* [2020-05-23] added a function to generate anchors given ratios and sizes
* [2020-05-17] created this repository

## Acknowledgement

The code of this repo is mainly an adaptation of https://github.com/zhouyuangan/K-Means-Anchors.

Compared to the original, the K-Means implementation of this repo is more than 50x faster and some additional features are provided.
